# Raspi_Stalker
Raspberry Pi 2 surveillence camera set up outside of a classroom on campus. Takes pictures based on movement, uploads it to Twitter along with a tweet about what class the students are coming from. Gets this information from class schedules on [umd.io](http://umd.io), the API for University of Maryland data.
